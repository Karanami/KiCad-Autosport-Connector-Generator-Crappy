# KiCad-Autosport-Connector-Generator-Crappy
It's a simple program which generates a basic footprint for all Autosport connectors (I think so) by providing it some basic values like:
-{file_in_name}.csv
-{file_out_name}.kicad_mod; //will crate if doesn't exists
-sheel diameter
-component's name
-drill size
-via outer diameter

it works, well enough
